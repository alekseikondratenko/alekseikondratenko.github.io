### Tuesday. 5th July

We finished a 2nd course (from Udemy). That was a demanding one, the guy was basically 
commenting on his code without much explanation. 

We connected three.js to socket.io and going to experiment with it tomorrow.

### Wednesday. 6th July

We experimented with three.js and socket.io. It works. We got a cube that can be moved by the user in one window and the results can be visible in all other. And vice versa. Tomorrow we plan to make kind of a little game out of it.

### Thursday. 7th July

The game is done and working locally. Tomorrow we will deploy it to Heroku.

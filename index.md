Here Ram and Aleksei are showing their results regarding [Real-time collaboration challenge](https://djcldy.github.io/DBF-Creative-Coding/www/challenges/rtc/index.html).

Our [Github repo](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Collaborative-drawing)

You can start playing [here](https://r200dollars.herokuapp.com/). **Please navigate to 'instructions and limitations' before the start of the game.**

## Project idea

The AEC industry has a lack of development, digitalization, and collaboration. Even though recent BIM developments allowed users to exchange models and data, it is still far from real-time collaboration. Using videogames terminology, we would like to change how people design buildings from step-based strategy (like XCOM) to real-time strategy (RTS, like StarCraft). Our project is the first step towards this goal. Here, you can collaboratively move objects in space, change their scale, rotate them, and create new ones also having the opportunity to chat. Even though, it is a raw prototype, we believe it makes clear an idea of real-time collaboration and its value during the buildingâ€™s design stage.

## Instructions and limitations

- Please look at 'controls' for the instructions.
- Please note, that the position **only of the last generated object** is updated for all the clients.
- It is better if all the clients start a game before the movement of the first object.
- You cannot delete the objects. If you feel there is a mess on a canvas, just update the page and start again.

## What we learned working on this project

- Socket.io and server-client relantionship for multiplayer games.
- Node.js and how to launch three.js canvas without a Webpack.
- Improved the knowledge of Javascript in general and three.js in particular.
- Github pages.
- How to deploy a project to Heroku.

## Project development

### Step 1

We completed 2 cources related to p5js, nodejs, express and socket.io.

The results of the step 1 was the real-time updated canvas taken from one of the cources

### Step 2

We connected three.js canvas to the initial prototype and made it work for all the clients using socket.io

### Step 3

We made our objects connected for each client in terms of their position, scale and shape. Also, it is possible to add additional cube pressing a button on a keybord. In addition, we added 'controls' to help user to play our game.

### Step 4

We added a chat to our game and deployed it to Heroku.
